# Tester Creator
A test user creation form for ADURO, Inc.

#### Role
UX Researcher, UX/UI Designer

#### Tools and Technologies
Adobe XD

## Project Goal
The project aimed to create a web form for creating test user logins for production websites.

__Form Requirements:__
* Client web site and Private Shared Key (PSK)
* Client Admin login credentials
* Number of Test Users needed
* Demographic information per test user (if needed)
* Demographic information for each user could contain multiple values  (e.g., from Seattle and enrolled in health insurance).

__Constraints:__
* Sensitive data (Administrator usernames and passwords, Private Shared Keys) could not be stored in the application
* Current demographic data could not be pulled into the application
* Test users could not be created via API, and the form could not complete the entire user creation process

The application would be utilized by Account Managers on ADURO's Client Services team.

The project timeline consisted of a two week Design Sprint followed by a two week Development Sprint.
It was unclear whether or not future sprints would occur.

## Wireframes
I created initial wireframes on paper, then began creating digital versions of the wireframes in Adobe XD.
The initial wireframes included the ability to add 4 values of demographic information per test user.
I designed the UX around submitting the form and then informing the user of remaining steps in the process.

## User Research
Due to the project's short timeline, I elected to conduct a focus group of the core user group during the design phase. I utilized the initial Adobe XD wireframes of the design to elicit responses on what UX/UI elements were clear and what needed more explanation.
I also confirmed with the core user base whether the overall flow matches their mental model of the website test user creation process.
Through this research, I also found that users preferred to add one column of demographic information at a time.

## Mockup
After the focus group, I updated the mid-fidelity wireframes to match the research findings. I then created a mockup of the form using Adobe XD. I included page flows, interactions, and error handling, for clarity with the development team.
Because the form requires asking for potentially unfamiliar data (e.g., PSK, Is Targeting Required?), I elected to write tooltips reminding users of what data is required for each field and where to find that data for their client.

I handed off my mockup, assets, and specifications to our Web Development team to complete the final product.
