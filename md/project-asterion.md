## Project Goal
The aim of this project was to automate a portion of ADURO, Inc.'s content upload process. For a large portion of the Website Configuration team's job, they were having to create HTML-based content and paste it into a .csv file. This project was scoped to allow the team to use a content loading tool to pull the content from a library, then send the content from a web application to an API endpoint.
The initial sole stakeholders were the Website Configuration team that were loading the content. The product evolved to include the Client Service team in order to further optimize the content loading process.

## User Flows
I made user flows for both the Configuration team and the Client Service team. I separated the journeys based on the task they were aiming to accomplish, as the tool would be used differently at different points in the year, depending on workload.
I met with the stakeholders and the development team to ensure that my user flows met their expectations and goals.

## Prototypes
My initial prototype (created in Adobe XD) included only the loading portion of the project. After the prototype's creation, more features were added to the product that necessitated additional screens and flows, namely a way to administer content and application users.
For the administration pages, I created a dashboard with a sidebar that the team immediately loved.

## User Research
After consulting with our project sponsor and end users, I found that the start screen needed to have the client search functionality front and center. I changed the tab order to meet this need.

## Coding
I created a web prototype for the application using HTML, SCSS, Bourbon + Neat, JavaScript, and jQuery.
The Lead Developer for the project utilized my codebase to include the styling into the React-based single-page application.
From that point on, I worked on the code utilizing React, SCSS, ES6 JavaScript, node/npm, and webpack.
