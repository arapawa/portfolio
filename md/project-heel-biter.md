# Heel Biter
This project was intended to optimize the content creation process across multiple teams. The company's prior content creation process involved using multiple tools and teams. There were multiple handoffs and a lot of room for errors or task-dropping.
The product was also meant to solve the biggest issue in the prior process: there was no feasible way for content requestors to view the content while it was in process or to approve it before launch.

## Project Goal
The project scope aimed to solve several issues across the company's creation process: the process involved using multiple disparate tools, documents got lost during handoffs, and the overall process was slow and lacked strict deadlines, structure, or ETAs. The project scope included a way for all teams to view the current status of content at any stage in the creation process. The scope also involved a way for content to be requested, created, edited, and previewed.
The project's initial stakeholders included the configuration and development team. Although we received buy-in from the content creation team later on, this was after the project had been postponed.

## User Flows
The application's flow was crucial, as it would dictate how users would complete their job functions.
As this product would be drastically different than the previous workflow (Project Management tool -> Microsoft Word -> Project Management tool), it was necessary to decide how disruptive our product would be. We weighed the benefits of being similar to the current flow vs. creating something new. The team decided that integrating with the current project management tool and optimizing the remainder of the process would lead to the most user delight. I looked foward to conducting usability testing of this, but the project was halted prior to testing.

## Prototypes
When prototyping, I spent more time exploring how the tracker functionality would look and interact. I brought my ideas to the team and got approval from the stakeholders and development team on a layout and flow.
I decided to prototype several of my content creation sketches in order to better see how they would function and look in a web application.

## User Research
This project was put on hold before user research and testing could be conducted.

## Final Product
This project is currently on hiatus while other high-priority products are being developed.
